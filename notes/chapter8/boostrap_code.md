# Boostrap

- For the boostrap this is the process I will follow

    - produce assembly of:
        - SP=256 // Initialize the stack pointer to 0x0100
        - call Sys.init // Start executing (the translated code of ) Sys.init
    - Think the other things I don't have to them because they need to be
      provided:

        - sys.init
        - main --> main.init
